# Market URL Scheme Fix

## Problem
The application was failing to launch `market://` URLs because the scheme does not have a registered handler on certain devices or platforms. This commonly occurs when:

1. The device doesn't have Google Play Store installed
2. The browser doesn't support the `market://` scheme
3. The URL scheme is blocked by security policies

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced URL Handling (`src/utils/urlHandler.ts`)
Created a comprehensive utility module that provides:

- **Platform Detection**: Accurately detects Android, iOS, and desktop platforms
- **Safe Navigation**: Handles URL navigation with proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Market URL Handler**: Specifically handles `market://` URLs with multiple fallback strategies
- **App Store URL Creation**: Generates appropriate URLs for different platforms

### 2. Improved Fallback Strategy
The solution implements a multi-tier fallback approach:

#### For Android:
1. **Primary**: Try `market://` URL
2. **Secondary**: Use Android Intent URL with Play Store fallback
3. **Tertiary**: Direct web URL to Play Store

#### For iOS:
1. **Primary**: Direct App Store URL
2. **Secondary**: Web fallback if needed

#### For Desktop/Other:
1. **Primary**: Direct web URL to Play Store

### 3. Updated Movie Page (`src/pages/movie.tsx`)
Enhanced the `handleDeeplink` function to:

- Use the new utility functions for better error handling
- Implement proper timeout handling (increased to 2 seconds)
- Add comprehensive fallback mechanisms
- Improve platform-specific logic

## Key Features

### Intent URL Format
For Android devices, the solution uses the Android Intent URL format:
```
intent://details?id=package.name&referrer=encoded_referrer#Intent;scheme=market;package=com.android.vending;end|https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=package.name
```

This format allows the browser to:
1. Try the `market://` scheme first
2. Fall back to the web URL if the scheme fails

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all navigation attempts
- Console warnings for debugging failed attempts
- Graceful degradation to web URLs when schemes fail

### Platform-Specific Logic
- **Android**: Uses iframe for deeplink attempts with extended timeout
- **iOS**: Direct navigation to App Store URLs
- **Desktop**: Web-based navigation only

## Testing

The solution includes unit tests (`src/utils/__tests__/urlHandler.test.ts`) that verify:
- Platform detection accuracy
- URL generation for different platforms
- URL scheme support detection

## Usage

The fix is automatically applied when users click on the app installation buttons. The system will:

1. Detect the user's platform
2. Attempt to open the app using the most appropriate method
3. Fall back to alternative methods if the primary method fails
4. Provide a seamless user experience across all platforms

## Benefits

- **Improved Success Rate**: Higher likelihood of successful app launches
- **Better User Experience**: Seamless fallbacks prevent user frustration
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on all major platforms and browsers
- **Maintainable Code**: Centralized URL handling logic
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
